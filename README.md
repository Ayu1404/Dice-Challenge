# **Dice Challenge**

A simple, interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The **Dice Challenge** generates a random dice roll for two players whenever the page is refreshed, determining the winner or a draw.

---

## **Features**
- **Random Dice Rolls**:
  - Generates a random number between 1 and 6 for each player upon refreshing the page.
- **Dynamic Dice Display**:
  - Displays a dice image corresponding to the random number rolled.
- **Player Outcome Announcement**:
  - Declares "Player 1 Wins!", "Player 2 Wins!" or "Draw!" based on the dice rolls.
- **Minimalistic Design**:
  - A clean and easy-to-use interface.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: Structures the content and elements of the dice game.
- **CSS3**: Provides the visual styles and layout.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Implements logic for random dice rolls and outcome determination.
  - Dynamically updates the DOM to reflect results.

## **Getting Started**

## **How to Play**
1. **Roll the Dice**:
   - Refresh the web page to roll the dice for both players.
2. **View Results**:
   - Check the result displayed at the top of the page:
     - "Player 1 Wins!ðŸš©" if Player 1 rolls a higher number.
     - "ðŸš©Player 2 Wins!" if Player 2 rolls a higher number.
     - "Draw!" if both players roll the same number.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Generate Random Numbers**:
   - Uses `Math.random()` to generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each player.
2. **Update Dice Images**:
   - Dynamically updates the `src` attribute of the dice images to display the correct dice face.
3. **Determine the Winner**:
   - Compares the two dice rolls and updates the `<h1>` element with the corresponding outcome.

---

## **File Structure**
### **index.html**:
- Contains the structure for the dice game interface.
- Includes `<img>` tags for two dice and a `<h1>` for the game outcome.

### **index.js**:
- Implements the random dice roll logic.
- Updates the dice images and the winner text dynamically.

### **styles.css**:
- (Optional if provided): Defines the visual layout and enhances the design of the dice game.
